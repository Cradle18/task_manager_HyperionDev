# Task Manager

I completed this program as part of my HyperionDev Software Development Fundamentals bootcamp. The task was to refractor the task manager program that they provided and added new features following this criteria: 

- Refractor the code using the principle of absctraction
- Fix the error's in the original code
- Add specified menu options to users called Admin, that show statical informatin about user and tasks
- Create functionality for users to view there tasks and edit them, in a user friendly way
- Write all tasks and users to text files


I have implemented the program in python, and you can find the source code in this repository.
